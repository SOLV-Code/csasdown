#' Inject verbatim text from Rmd files into Rmd code
#'
#' @description
#' Inject verbatim text from Rmd files into Rmd code wrapped in
#' [cat()] so that the bilingual features of csasdown can be used properly
#' but the author can write paragraphs or sections in pure Rmarkdown.
#' Uses [read_rmd_file()] to read in the file and place `cat()` around
#' the contents before injecting it
#'
#' @keywords internal
#'
#' @param rmd_files A vector of character strings representing the names
#' of Rmd files
#' @param line_offsets A [data.frame()] or [tibble::tibble()] containing the
#' line offsets to be added to line numbers in messages in order to give the
#' correct line numbers for the original files. Has columns `fn` (chr),
#' `chunk_header` (chr)  `chunk_ind` (int), `pre_num` (dbl), `post_num` (dbl),
#' and `rmd_num` (dbl). See `return` values for [inject_rmd_files()] and
#' [remove_comments_from_chunks()]
#' @param verbose Logical. If `TRUE`, print messages
#'
#' @return Nothing
