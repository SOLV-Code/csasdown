#' Create a copy of a bookdown YAML file containing modified Rmd File names
#' Create a copy of the RMd files listed, with the names listed in the new
#' YAML file
#'
#' @description
#' Creates a copy of a bookdown YAML file with "tmp_" prepended to the name.
#' Inside the new file, all listed Rmd files will have their names prepended
#' with "tmp_". Those files will also be created by copying the ones listed
#' in the original YAML file.
#'
#' @details
#' The file must have an entry like this:
#'
#' `` rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", ``
#' ``             "01-chap1.Rmd"] ``
#' ``            #"02-chap2.Rmd", ``
#' ``            #"03-chap3.Rmd", ``
#' ``            #"04-references.Rmd", ``
#' ``            #"05-appendix.Rmd"] ``
#'
#' This will appear in the new file as:
#'
#' `` rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", ``
#' ``             "tmp_01-chap1.Rmd"] ``
#'
#' The file must also have a line like this before the above list, which is
#' used as an index for where to insert the modified file list after:
#' book_filename: "resdoc"
#'
#' There are only two requirements to how the files are listed in the
#' `rmd_files: [` section: 1) they must begin right after the `[`
#' and 2) the closing `]` must be at the end of its line with no more code
#' following. They look nice as listed above but could be more than one to
#' a line, or all on one line.
#'
#' @keywords internal
#'
#' @param yaml_fn The [bookdown] YAML file name, by default is "_bookdown.yml"
#'
#' @return A list of two, 1) The name of the temporary YAML file created
#' 2) A vector of the temporary Rmd files created
