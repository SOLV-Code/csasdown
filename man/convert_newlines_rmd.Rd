\description{
Rmarkdown code requires several different entries to render newlines
in a final document. These are frustrating because the algorithm
is not clear on what you need for which case. For example, header lines
(lines starting with #) do not need a newline, but if you want 'N' blank
lines between the header and next text, you need 'N lines containing
only \\, without any empty lines following.
For other text, you need N + 1 lines containing only \\ with an empty line
following, before the next text occurs. List elements must not have newlines
between them.
This allows for 'What you see is what you get' in your Rmarkdown code.
