\title{Copy mirrored knitr chunk code into chunks with the mirrored call}
\usage{
copy_mirror_chunks(
  rmd_files,
  nowrite = FALSE,
  line_offsets = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rmd_files}{A vector of character strings representing the names
of Rmd files}

\item{nowrite}{Don't write the files, instead return the Rmd code as
elements of a list, with each element corresponding to the input files
in \code{rmd_files}. Needed for testing.}

\item{line_offsets}{A \code{\link[=data.frame]{data.frame()}} or \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} containing the
line offsets to be added to line numbers in messages in order to give the
correct line numbers for the original files. Has columns \code{fn} (chr),
\code{chunk_header} (chr)  \code{chunk_ind} (int), \code{pre_num} (dbl), \code{post_num} (dbl),
and \code{rmd_num} (dbl). See \code{return} values for \code{\link[=inject_rmd_files]{inject_rmd_files()}} and
\code{\link[=remove_comments_from_chunks]{remove_comments_from_chunks()}}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, print messages}
}
\value{
A vector of character strings representing the lines in an
Rmd file but with the mirrored calls replaced with code
}
\description{
Copy the mirrored chunk code into the chunk with the mirrored call.
knitr does this automatically but we need to do it in the pre-processing
step so we can modify the newlines in the mirrored code.
}
\details{
Search for chunks containing mirror code lines (looks like
\verb{<<chunk-name>>}), find the chunk-names and copy the code within those
chunks into the chunks with the mirror code lines, replacing them.
