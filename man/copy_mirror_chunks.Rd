\title{Copy mirrored knitr chunk code into chunks with the mirrored call}
\usage{
copy_mirror_chunks(rmd_files, nowrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rmd_files}{A vector of character strings representing the names
of Rmd files}

\item{nowrite}{Don't write the files, instead return the Rmd code as
elements of a list, with each element corresponding to the input files
in \code{rmd_files}. Needed for testing.}
}
\value{
A vector of character strings representing the lines in an
Rmd file but with the mirrored calls replaced with code
}
\description{
Copy the mirrored chunk code into the chunk with the mirrored call.
knitr does this automatically but we need to do it in the pre-processing
step so we can modify the newlines in the mirrored code.
}
\details{
Search for chunks containing mirror code lines (looks like \verb{<<chunk-name>>}),
find the chunk-names and copy the code within those chunks into the chunks
with the mirror code lines, replacing them.
